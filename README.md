# Kubernetes NodeJS Load-Balanced Deployment

Welcome to the Kubernetes-Practices repository! This project demonstrates best practices for deploying a NodeJS application on a Kubernetes cluster, ensuring optimal load balancing and providing easy access to users.

## Overview

This repository contains Kubernetes manifests, configuration files, and guidelines for deploying a scalable and resilient NodeJS application. By leveraging Kubernetes features such as deployments, services, and ingress controllers, we aim to showcase how to achieve efficient load distribution and seamless access to the deployed application.

## Features

- **Load Balancing**: Utilize Kubernetes deployments to scale and distribute the NodeJS application load evenly across multiple pods.
- **Service Discovery**: Employ Kubernetes services for automatic service discovery, enabling easy communication between application components.
- **Ingress Setup**: Configure Kubernetes ingress controllers to manage external access, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience.
- **Health Checks**: Implement health checks for application pods to enhance reliability and automated failover.

## Getting Started

To deploy the NodeJS application on your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/kubernetes-nodejs-load-balancer.git
   cd kubernetes-nodejs-load-balancer
